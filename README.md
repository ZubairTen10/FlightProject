| Layer        | Tech                     |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Backend      | Spring Boot (Java), REST |
| Frontend     | Vite, JS         |

## Dockerised Application

The entire application (frontend + backend) is bundled and served by a single Spring Boot container.

- `vite build` bundles all frontend code into static files (`main-[hash].js`, `main-[hash].css)
- These static files are served from Spring Boot's `resources/static` directory
- No need to copy `node_modules`, all dependencies are bundled into the final JS.
