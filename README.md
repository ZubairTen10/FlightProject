## 🐳 Dockerised Application

The entire application (frontend + backend) is bundled and served by a single Spring Boot container.

- `vite build` bundles all frontend code into static files (`main-[hash].js`, CSS)
- These static files are served from Spring Boot's `resources/static` directory
- No need to copy `node_modules` — all dependencies are bundled into the final JS
